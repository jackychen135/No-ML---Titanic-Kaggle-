# Titanic Kaggle without Machine Learning
Tackling the Titanic Kaggle ML problem without using any machine learning 

Examples of logic utilised in this solution includes:
- Statistics relevant to that time period e.g average lifespan of a human being back in 1900s,
- Establishing arbitary weights to determine what features are a stronger determinant of survivors
- Clearing out features that generally have nothing to learn from
- Developing manual algorithms to calculate those weights
